- This is an Angular 18 standalone component app (no NgModules)
- Use standalone components with imports declared in the component decorator
- Use reactive forms (FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators) for forms
- Use RxJS Observables for async operations
- Follow Angular style guide naming: feature.type.ts (e.g., task.service.ts)
- All routes use lazy loading via loadComponent()
- Always use Context7 MCP when referencing Angular, PG, or library APIs
